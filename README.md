# XIXe: the simplest economic(al) simulation game

## About the game

Heavily inspired by Paradox Interactive's Victoria 3, XIXe aims for a less-arcade & more-realistic simulation of economic mechanics.

Not to be expected as for now to be anything big, just a side project I made out of my complete love for the Victoria franchise.
